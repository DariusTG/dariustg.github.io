I really don't hate the paste function, it is actually quite useful when working with vectors. I just hate using it for simple string concatenation. 

{% assign image = page.images[0] %}
{% include image.html image=image %}

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

var = 4.345
paste0("The value is: ", var)

```

Luckily, R has the functionality to create binary operators so I rolled my own string concatenation operator.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

"%+%" = function(...) {paste0(...)}

"The value is: " %+% var

```
